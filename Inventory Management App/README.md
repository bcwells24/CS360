The inventory management application I developed was designed to fulfill several requirements including implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing inventory items and integrating SMS notifications to alert users when item quantities reached zero. The primary user needs this app addressed was the efficient management of inventory, allowing users to easily track their items and receive timely notifications to prevent stockouts.

To support user needs and create a user-centered UI, I included essential screens such as a login and registration screen, a main grid displaying inventory items, and an add item screen for users to input new items into the system. Each screen was designed with the user experience in mind; for instance, the main grid was organized for easy navigation, ensuring users could quickly find and manage their inventory. The design was successful because it focused on simplicity, clarity, and responsiveness, allowing users to interact with the app intuitively.

In coding the app, I adopted a structured approach, breaking down tasks into manageable components and utilizing best practices such as modular programming. Techniques like version control and iterative development helped streamline the coding process. These strategies can be applied in future projects by emphasizing collaboration and adaptability, especially when dealing with larger, more complex applications, with larger teams of people.

Testing was a critical aspect of ensuring the app's functionality. I employed both manual testing and user acceptance testing to verify that the app met user expectations and worked as intended. This process was important as it revealed areas needing improvement, ensuring the app was not only functional but also aligned with user needs. It would have been nice to have more users, however, to test the application. 

Throughout the design and development process, I faced challenges that required innovation, such as implementing SMS notifications, which necessitated integrating third-party APIs while ensuring compliance with privacy regulations. This experience deepened my understanding of app architecture, communication protocols, and permissions. 

One specific component where I demonstrated my knowledge and skills was in the database integration for CRUD operations. I effectively implemented the database logic, ensuring seamless data retrieval and updates, which was crucial for the app's functionality. This experience solidified my technical expertise and provided practical insights into building mobile applications.
